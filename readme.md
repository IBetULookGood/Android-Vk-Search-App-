## Getting Started
This application will work as follows: _the user_ will log into app, enter the ID of some VKontakte user in the VKontakte social network into a text field, and the application will display the name and surname of this VKontakte account to the user. In other words, we will be able to enter any ID of any Vkontakte account, the application will access the VKontakte server via the internet, retrieve data from the server, process the data, extract the name and surname,and display them to the user.
