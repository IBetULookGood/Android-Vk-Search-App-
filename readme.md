# Android App
Often, applications consist of multiple screens because different information needs to be displayed on different screens
![screens](<first.jpg>)

And for this, we should have multiple activities in out application because each activity is responsible for each of these screens. 
![first screen](<second.jpg>)
![second screen](<third.jpg>)
In Android, this is achieved using the Intents mechanism.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Android project:
